But just as your remote is called origin, you can give any remote a more memorable name. Your own origin has an upstream repository (mine); it’s a convention to name that upstream.

Add a remote
git remote add upstream git@github.com:evildmp/afraid-to-commit.git
Fetch remote data
The remote’s there, but you don’t yet have any information about it. You need to fetch that:

git fetch upstream
This means: get the latest information about the branches on upstream.
